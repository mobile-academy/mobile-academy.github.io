UICollectionView is a very powerful component in UIKit. Every iOS developer has heard about it, at least he should. It seems to be pretty straight forward and easy to use and manipulate. That is true, however... not entirely. UIColletionView has a lot of potential, which can be overwhelming and dangerous to careless programmer.

We provide great introduction to the UICollectionView subject! Register for our newsletter to be one of the first to learn about upcoming editions!
